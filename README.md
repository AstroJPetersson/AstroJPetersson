## Hej, & Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
- I'm a PhD Student in Theoretical & Computational Astrophysics @ EPFL
- My research involve studying black hole growth in low-mass dwarf galaxies, using numerical simulations
- I analyse large amounts of data regularly, & enjoy sharing the routines I use to visualise my simulations
- I'm interested in all things related to numerical simulations, as well as data analysis/science in general
- How to reach me: jonathan.petersson@epfl.ch
