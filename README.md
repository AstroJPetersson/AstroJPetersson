## Hej, and Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

- :telescope: I'm currently working on massive black hole accretion and feedback in low-mass dwarf galaxies, using numerical astrophysical simulations. 
- :minidisc: I'm actively analysing large amounts of data on a daily basis, and like to share some the routines I use to visualise my simulations.
- :thinking: I'm interested in all things related to numerical simulations, as well as data analysis/science in general.
- :mailbox: How to reach me: jonathan.petersson@epfl.ch
