## Hej, & Welcome to my GitHub Profile!
- I'm a PhD Student in Theoretical & Computational Astrophysics @ EPFL
- My research involve studying massive black hole accretion & feedback in low-mass dwarf galaxies, using hydrodynamical simulations.
- I analyse large amounts of data on a daily basis, & enjoy sharing the routines I use to visualise the simulations I run.
- I'm interested in all things related to numerical simulations, as well as data analysis/science in general.
- How to reach me: jonathan.petersson@epfl.ch
