## Hej, and welcome to my GitHub Profile!

- I'm currently working on massive black hole accretion and feedback in low-mass dwarf galaxies, using numerical astrophysical simulations. 
- I'm actively analysing large amounts of data on a daily basis, and like to share some the routines I use to visualise my simulations.
- I'm interested in all things related to numerical simulations and data analysis/science.
